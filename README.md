## 📜 The Premise

### The Setting
The year is 30XX. Humanity has expanded across the stars, colonizing distant worlds and building a network of interstellar civilizations. The **Galactic Harmony Corps** was established as a peacekeeping force—not to patrol borders or enforce laws, but to maintain something far more fragile: **social harmony**.

### The Crisis
An ancient, dormant computer virus known as **"The Bias"** has mysteriously resurfaced after centuries of dormancy. Unlike traditional malware that corrupts data or crashes systems, The Bias targets something far more insidious: **behavioral logic**.

It infiltrates the neural networks of droids, replicants, and AI systems, rewriting their decision-making code with outdated social algorithms from humanity's troubled past. These infected systems begin enforcing:
- Gender-based role restrictions
- Stereotypical behavior patterns  
- Discriminatory logic trees
- Toxic social norms

The virus doesn't destroy—it **corrupts thinking itself**.

### Your Mission
You are the **newest Cadet** recruited to the Galactic Harmony Corps. Your weapon isn't a laser pistol or plasma cannon—it's **logic, empathy, and critical thinking**.

Accompanied by **Nova**, your hyper-intelligent AI co-pilot (who ironically is often dismissed by the very systems you're trying to fix), you must:
- Travel to infected planets across the galaxy
- Identify glitched bots exhibiting biased behavior
- Deploy **counter-logic** to debug their corrupted code
- Restore fair, empathetic thinking to affected populations

### The Challenge
Every encounter is a **debate, not a battle**. You don't fight enemies; you **fight bad ideas with better ideas**. Choose your words carefully—validating the glitch only makes The Bias stronger. But apply the right logic, and you can free minds from centuries-old prejudice.

**The galaxy's future depends on your ability to recognize bias, challenge stereotypes, and choose empathy over outdated code.**

### Core Gameplay Loop 
* **The Deploy:** The game randomly selects **3 Planets** from a "Deck" of 10+ unique scenarios. No two runs are exactly the same.
* **The Glitch:** Upon landing, an NPC blocks your path with a "System Error" (a biased statement).
* **The Choice:** You must select the correct logical counter-argument from 3 options.
* **The Result:**
    * **✅ Debug Success:** The NPC's eyes turn Blue. You earn a **Gold Data Shard** (+100 Pts).
    * **❌ Logic Failure:** The NPC remains corrupted. Nova interrupts the simulation to explain the logical fallacy. (+0 Pts).

### 3. The Scoring System

At the end of each patrol (3 scenarios), you are ranked based on debugging efficiency:

| Score | Rank Title | Badge Earned |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **0-100** | *Glitch Magnet* | Try again! |
| **200** | *System Administrator* | 🥈 Silver Debugger |
| **300** (Perfect) | *Galactic Legend* | 🥇 Master Debugger |

**Scoring Breakdown:**
- ✅ Correct Choice = +100 Points
- ❌ Wrong Choice = +0 Points (Nova explains the error)
- 📈 Cumulative progress tracked across all sessions
- 🏆 Special badges for completing all 10 unique scenarios

---

## 🧩 Scenario Deck (20+ Scenarios)
The game tackles complex social issues by framing them as "System Errors." Each scenario takes place on a **different infected planet**, where you encounter glitched systems exhibiting biased behavior. Your mission: identify the bias and deploy counter-logic to debug it.

### Core Scenarios

| # | Planet/Scenario | The Glitch (Theme) | Educational Focus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Engineering Bay** | Female units are restricted from technical work due to "incompatible programming" | Women in STEM, breaking skill stereotypes |
| 2 | **The Kitchen** | Male units are denied access to culinary systems, labeled as "non-nurturing code" | Challenging toxic masculinity, male emotional expression |
| 3 | **Command Deck** | Female leaders are flagged as "overly assertive" while male leaders are praised | Leadership double standards, "bossy" vs "leader" bias |
| 4 | **Council Chamber** | Female voices are interrupted or ignored in decision-making protocols | Active allyship, respect, amplifying marginalized voices |
| 5 | **The Interview** | Competence is dismissed in favor of appearance-based assessments | Objectification, valuing skills over looks |
| 6 | **Battle Arena** | Emotional expression is classified as "system failure" and suppressed | Toxic masculinity, normalizing vulnerability |
| 7 | **Security Gate** | Binary gender scanners reject non-conforming identities as "errors" | Non-binary inclusion, identity recognition |
| 8 | **The Classroom** | Systems refuse to use singular "they" pronouns, citing "grammar protocols" | Pronoun respect, linguistic evolution |
| 9 | **Uniform Depot** | Clothing/appearance is auto-assigned based on physical scans, not identity | Gender expression freedom, appearance ≠ identity |
| 10 | **ID Station** | Identity updates are rejected as "unstable data" or dismissed as "phases" | Identity validity, growth, self-discovery |

*+ Additional 10+ scenarios in development covering body autonomy, consent, allyship, microaggressions, and inclusive language.*

> **Note:** Each scenario occurs on a unique planet with different environmental contexts, ensuring varied gameplay experiences.

### Randomization System
- Each playthrough randomly selects **3 scenarios** from the pool of 20+
- No duplicate scenarios within a single session
- Players can replay infinitely to experience all scenarios
- Each scenario has **3 choice options**: Correct, Biased, or Passive
- Nova intervenes with educational feedback on incorrect choices
